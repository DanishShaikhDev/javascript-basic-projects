Welcome to my JavaScript projects repository. In this repository, I'll be showcasing a collection of practical JavaScript projects.

The "To-Do List" project is a simple yet functional web application built with JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks and stay organized.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the live demo of this project.
